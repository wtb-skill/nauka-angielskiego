Basic idea:
- imports 3000 most common English words
- gives the user 10 words 
- the user interacts with those words and needs to get 6 stars (or points) on each word
- you get 1 star when you successfully translate the word
- first 3 times you translate from English to Polish, later from Polish to English
- whenever you make a mistake, 1 star is taken away from you
- if you master the word (6 stars) the word disappears from your list and is replaced by a new word from the starting list of words (3000 minus the ones in hand and mastered)

- possible options:
- chat GPT to check your sentances with the chosen word (might be the final test)
